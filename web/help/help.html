<h4 id="help-basics">Basic operation</h4>
<p>
Prolog is about running a <i>query</i> against a <i>program</i>. The
<i>query</i> goes into the bottom-right editor and the <i>program</i>
into the left editor.  The program can be empty, executing queries
against the <i>built-in</i> predicates of Prolog.  For example:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
?- format("Hello world!~n").</pre>

<p>
A query can be executed by hitting <code>RETURN</code> if the query
is complete and the caret is behind the '.' that terminates the query
or by using the <b>Run!</b> button.  At this moment, the following happens:

<ol>
  <li>The interface creates a <em>runner</em> in the top-right window
      that controls the execution of the query.
  <li>The runner collects the text from the top-left editor (if any)
      and the query and sends this to the server, which creates a <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pengines">Pengine</a>
      (<i>Prolog Engine</i>).
  <li>The Pengine compiles the program into a temporary private module.
  <li>The Pengine assesses whether executing the query can compromise
      the server.  If this fails, an error is displated.  See
      the help topic <b>Caveats ...</b> for details.
  <li>If the query is considered safe, it executes the query and
      communicates with the <em>runner</em>
      about the results using JSON messages.  The <em>runner</em>
      interaction is described in the help topic <b>Runner ...</b>
</ol>

<p>
Note that <b>you do not have to save your program to execute it</b>.  If
your are not satisfied with the answer to a query, you can simply
edit the program and use the <b>Run!</b> again.  The new query is
executed in a completely new environment.  In particular, data that
you asserted in a previous query is not available in the next.

<h4 id="help-examples">Embedding examples in the program text</h4>
<p>
If you include example goals inside comments as shown below,
they will be used to populate the example menu and make the
first goal show in the Goal input field.
</p>
<pre style="font-size:80%">
/** &lt;examples&gt;

?- loves(X, mia).
?- jealous(X, Y).

*/</pre>

<h4 id="help-share">Save or share your program</h4>
<p>
The menu <b>File/Save ...</b> can be used to save your program.  There
are several options:

  <ul>
    <li>By default, the program is saved to a randomly generated name
        and may be searched by all users.  The <b>Public | Name</b> fields
	can be used to hide the file and/or give it a name.
    <li>The title is displayed in the search results and can help others
        to guess what the file is about.
    <li>You can fill in the author.  Future versions are likely to use
        login for that.
    <li>If an updated version of the file is changed, <b>Changes</b> may
        be used to summarise the changes.
    <li>Tags may be added to help people finding your code.  Type a comma
        (,) to start a new tag.
  </ul>

<p>
The <b>Info &amp; History ...</b> menu can be used to examine and use
old versions of the program.

<h4 id="help-include">Include other programs</h4>
<p>
If you know the name of a saved program (see above), you can reuse this
program using Prolog's <b>include/1</b> predicate as illustrated below.

<pre style="font-size:80%">
:- include(clever).
</pre>

You can also include a <em>specific version</em> of a program by including
its <em>hash</em>.  You can find the hash of a specific version using
<b>Info &amp; History ...</b>, selecting the desired version and opening
it using the <em>play</em> button.  This will display the hash in the
browser's address field.  Now, include this version using e.g.,

<pre style="font-size:80%">
:- include('23dacada6952ec6701da2dc9d4ebcf5c7b860380').
</pre>

<p>
Using <b>File/Collaborate ...</b>, you create a
<a target="_blank" href="https://togetherjs.com/">TogetherJS</a> session
that provides shared editing, chat and voice communication.

<h4 id="help-preload">Preload SWISH with data</h4>
<p>
You can make <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
start with a loaded program using the URL <code>http://swish.swi-prolog.org/</code> and
providing the parameters below.  The URL accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests.

  <dl>
  <dt>code<dd>
  Either the concrete code or a URL from which the code will be downloaded.
  </dd>
  <dt>background<dd>
  As <code>code</code>, but this part of the code will not be visible in
  the editor.
  </dd>
  <dt>examples<dd>
  As the above described examples comment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>q<dd>
  The initial query to load into the query window.  Note that the following
  characters need to be escaped: '#', '&' and the space.
  </dd>
  </dl>

<p>The URL below opens <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> on a file from GitHub with a default query.
