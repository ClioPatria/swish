<h4 id="help-basics">Basic operation</h4>
<p>
Prolog is about running a <i>query</i> against a <i>program</i>. The
<i>query</i> goes into the bottom-right editor and the <i>program</i>
into the left editor.  The program can be empty, executing queries
against the <i>built-in</i> predicates of Prolog.  For example:

<pre style="font-size:80%">
?- format("Hello world!~n").</pre>

<p>
A query can be executed by hitting <code>RETURN</code> if the query
is complete and the caret is behind the '.' that terminates the query
or by using the <b>Run!</b> button.  At this moment, the following happens:

<ol>
  <li>The interface creates a <em>runner</em> in the top-right window
      that controls the execution of the query.
  <li>The runner collects the text from the top-left editor (if any)
      and the query and sends this to the server, which creates a <a target="_blank"
      href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pengines">Pengine</a>
      (<i>Prolog Engine</i>).
  <li>The Pengine compiles the program into a temporary private module.
  <li>The Pengine assesses whether executing the query can compromise
      the server.  If this fails, an error is displated.  See
      the help topic <b>Caveats ...</b> for details.
  <li>If the query is considered safe, it executes the query and
      communicates with the <em>runner</em>
      about the results using JSON messages.  The <em>runner</em>
      interaction is described in the help topic <b>Runner ...</b>
</ol>

<p>
Note that <b>you do not have to save your program to execute it</b>.  If
your are not satisfied with the answer to a query, you can simply
edit the program and use the <b>Run!</b> again.  The new query is
executed in a completely new environment.  In particular, data that
you asserted in a previous query is not available in the next.

<h4 id="help-examples">Embedding examples in the program text</h4>
<p>
If you include example goals inside comments as shown below,
they will be used to populate the example menu and make the
first goal show in the Goal input field.
</p>
<pre style="font-size:80%">
/** &lt;examples&gt;

?- loves(X, mia).
?- jealous(X, Y).

*/</pre>

<h4 id="help-share">Save or share your program</h4>
<p>
If you use <b>File/Save</b>, the server will save your program in a file
with a unique random name and add this name to the URL displayed in the
browser's address bar. You can later come back to this source by going
to this URL. You can also sent the URL to a friend and let him or her
have a look at your program.  Anyone can save the program, but the last
one wins.  In the future, we will add versioning.

<p>
Using <b>File/Collaborate ...</b>, you create a
<a target="_blank" href="https://togetherjs.com/">TogetherJS</a> session
that provides shared editing, chat and voice communication.

<h4 id="help-preload">Preload SWISH with data</h4>
<p>
You can make <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span>
start with a loaded program using the URL <code>http://swish.swi-prolog.org/</code> and
providing the parameters below.  The URL accepts both `GET` and `POST` requests.

  <dl>
  <dt>code<dd>
  Either the concrete code or a URL from which the code will be downloaded.
  </dd>
  <dt>background<dd>
  As <code>code</code>, but this part of the code will not be visible in
  the editor.
  </dd>
  <dt>examples<dd>
  As the above described examples comment block.
  </dd>
  <dt>q<dd>
  The initial query to load into the query window.  Note that the following
  characters need to be escaped: '#', '&' and the space.
  </dd>
  </dl>

<p>The URL below opens <span style="color:darkblue">SWI</span><span style="color:maroon">SH</span> on a file from GitHub with a default query.
