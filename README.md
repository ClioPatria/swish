# [ClioPatria](http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org) cpack swish -- Add Prolog interaction to ClioPatria

Make the SWI-Prolog [SWISH](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swish.git)
package available as a ClioPatria _cpack_.  SWISH brings a Prolog
interface to ClioPatria, providing:

  - Ask RDF queries about our data
  - Make example programs available about your data
  - Save an example program and share it with anyone on the web
  - Collaborate on a program using [TogetheJS](https://togetherjs.com/)
  - Manage a server remotely from the Prolog shell (requires login with
    `admin` rigths).

This package is just a first preview. We have many plans for making this
more powerful and friendly.
